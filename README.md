# rakkoon
A(nother) parser combinator library for Kotlin.

This project is just starting, but the goals of the project are as follows.

## Goals
 * Have a simple and extendable api based on Rules that are made up of a Pattern and an Action that runs when a Pattern matches.
 * Good error messages
 * Have extensive tests
 * Eventually support a streaming parser based on Kotlin's Flows
 * Stay up on the current Kotlin version
 * Use Arrow alongside the Kotlin Standard Library
