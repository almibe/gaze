# rakkoon
Rakkoon is a small utility library with the goal of making it easier to scan/lex Strings in Kotlin.

It's experimental at the moment and not optimized at all, so you can play around with it, but don't expect much.

It's currently being used in anger in the [slonky](https://github.com/almibe/slonky) project.
